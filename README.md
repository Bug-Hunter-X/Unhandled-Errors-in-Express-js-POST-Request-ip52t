# Unhandled Errors in Express.js POST Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling for POST requests.  The `bug.js` file showcases a vulnerable server that doesn't properly handle potential errors during JSON parsing and database operations.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Bug Description

The original code lacks error handling for:

* **Malformed JSON:**  If the client sends invalid JSON, the server might crash or return an unexpected error.
* **Database Errors:** If there's a problem during database insertion (e.g., database connection failure, constraint violation), the server should gracefully handle the error and inform the client.

## Solution

The solution involves using appropriate middleware (e.g., `express.json()` with error handling) and try-catch blocks to catch potential exceptions during database operations.  Comprehensive error responses are provided to the client.
